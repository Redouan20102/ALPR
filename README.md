# Licence plate recognition using multi-attributes fusion


This is my engineering end-of-studies project, in which I implemented a methode based on data fusion by using the theory of evidence to recognize the characters of a licence plate. 


the module that does the location and the segmentation of the licence plate is re-used from a repo that I honestly forgot, if you recognize its source please mention it. 


the yolov4 model is missing in the files, if you want it just contact me @ r.hadjaissa@gmail.com
